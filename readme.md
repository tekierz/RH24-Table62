# Mirag√© - The Smart Mirror

A Python-based smart mirror application that combines computer vision, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing to create an interactive experience. The system detects people in real-time, analyzes their appearance using a combination of YOLOv5, Llama 3.2 (via Lambda Labs), and OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini, and delivers witty responses through speech synthesis, while also providing useful information like weather updates. 

## Core Technologies

### AI and Machine Learning
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision**: Powers image analysis and generates contextual responses
- **OpenCV**: Handles real-time computer vision and person detection
- **YOLOv5**: Provides real-time person detection with high accuracy
- **PyTorch**: Supports deep learning models for advanced computer vision tasks

### Integration & Services
- **Discord Bot**: Remote control, monitoring, and image sharing capabilities
- **OpenWeather API**: Real-time weather information and condition-aware fashion advice
- **Text-to-Speech**: Voice output using platform-specific engines

## Features

### Person Detection
- Real-time person tracking using YOLOv5
- Adjustable confidence threshold (using '[' and ']' keys)
- Configurable center detection region (using '-' and '+' keys)
- Automatic person presence tracking with cooldown timer

### Fashion Analysis Styles
Five different critic personalities available (switch using number keys 1-5):
1. Kind & Child-Friendly: Supportive and encouraging feedback
2. Professional & Balanced: Constructive professional styling advice
3. Weather-Aware: Context-aware fashion suggestions based on current weather
4. Ultra-Critical Expert: High-standard professional critique
5. Savage Roast Master: Dramatic and theatrical fashion commentary

### Controls
- **SPACE**: Force trigger next roast
- **BACKSPACE**: Skip current roast
- **Q**: Quit application
- **C**: Clear audio playback
- **1-5**: Switch between critic styles
- **[ ]**: Adjust detection confidence
- **- +**: Adjust center region size

### Discord Integration
- Automatic sharing of fashion critiques with images
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Dedicated channel for mirror interactions

### Weather Integration
- Real-time weather condition monitoring
- Weather-aware fashion advice
- Temperature and condition-specific recommendations

## Project Structure
- `mirror.py`: Main application entry point and core logic
- `discord_bot.py`: Discord integration for remote monitoring
- `weather_service.py`: OpenWeather API integration
